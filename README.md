# Ashwin Rajesh

I am Ashwin, a first year MTech student in *Microelectronics and VLSI Design* at the *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*, (hopefully) focused on digital hardware design and computer architecture. I document most of the work i do here. Some of my work:

1) [Cordic Accelerator](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Cordic_accelerator)
2) [RiSC-16 CPU](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/RiSC-16)
3) [Verilog communication protocols](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Verilog_comm)
4) [28nm CMOS Schmitt trigger](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/CMOS_Schmitt)
5) [RTL design notes](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/RTL_Notes)

Alonside hardware design, I enjoy programming and creating random (sometimes useless) hobby projects, from arduino to robotics and ML and this is where a lot of them reside.

1) [Universal infrared remote](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/UniversalRemote_ESP32)
2) [Stroboscopic waterfall](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Quintessence-StroboscopicWater)
3) [Step piano](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Quintessence-StepPiano)
4) [POV display](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/POV-display)
5) [Morse encoder](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Morse-Sender)
6) [GNSS and IMU sensor fusion](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Kalman_filter_carla)
7) [CV for lane detection](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/LaneDetection)
