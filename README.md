# Ashwin Rajesh

I am a first-year MTech student in *Microelectronics and VLSI Design* at the *Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore*, and part of the [NeuRonICs](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/neuronics/) lab at DESE. My interests are in digital hardware design (and software co-design) for efficient computing. Currently working on the design of low-power hardware for real-time image classification inference on the edge.

### 1) [LifeOnChip](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/LifeOnChip)
- 16x16 array of convay's game of life in silicon (Skywater130)
### 2) [Function generator](https://github.com/fpga_functiongen)
- Dual channel sqaure, sawtooth or sinusoidal function generator (using CORDIC)
- On BASYS3 FPGA
### 3) [Microspice](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/microspice)
- A tiny spice parser and engine written in python
### 4) [Cordic Accelerator](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Cordic_accelerator)
- An AXI-Lite IP that performs the CORDIC algorithm
- Extensive convergence and error characterization using randomized inputs
### 5) [RiSC-16 CPU](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/RiSC-16)
- 16-bit CPU with a 4-stage pipeline
- Random instruction generator and assembler (python)
- Random testing for 100,000 instructions (compared with a gold standard)
### 6) [Verilog communication protocols](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Verilog_comm)
- SPI, I2C and UART master and slave
### 7) [28nm CMOS Schmitt trigger](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/CMOS_Schmitt)
### 8) [RTL design notes](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/RTL_Notes)
- Verilog
- System verilog
- Formal verification with symbiyosys

Alongside hardware design, I enjoy programming and creating random (sometimes useless) hobby projects, from Arduino to robotics and ML and this is where a lot of them reside.

1) [GNSS and IMU sensor fusion using Kalman filter (in carla)](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Kalman_filter_carla)
2) [Lane Detection using Computer Vision](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/LaneDetection)
3) [Universal infrared remote](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/UniversalRemote_ESP32)
4) [Stroboscopic waterfall](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Quintessence-StroboscopicWater)
5) [Step piano](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Quintessence-StepPiano)
6) [POV display](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/POV-display)
7) [Morse encoder](https://github.com/Ashwin-Rajesh/Morse-Sender)
